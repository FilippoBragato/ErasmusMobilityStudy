# IP prject: Erasmus+ Study mobility in 2018 with a focus on Italian Universities

## OUR TOPIC: ERASMUS+ STUDY MOBILITY IN EUROPE

Our idea for this project is to visualize and analyze this network of exchanges, and how each
university is connected inside the network, focusing mostly on Italian universities.

We chose to focus on one year only in order to have a clear and complete picture, so we chose to
analyze the study programmes which took place in the academic year 2017/2018, both for
availability of data and proximity in time (leaving out the years which were affected by the Covid-19
pandemic). [Source: dataset (https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/erasmus-mobility-statistics-2014-
2018?locale=en)]

## MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS

- How are european universities linked according to students mobility within the Erasmus+ study
programme?
- What are the differences in outgoing and incoming students for each university?
- What is the specific role of italian universities inside the network?

## WHAT DO WE WANT?

- Italian universities (how each of them is linked inside the network);
- Field of study (in order to understand trends inside the network);
- Any other element which could be interesting to single out, in the light of available data.
- We would like to have a clear visualization of the whole network, i.e. how all European universities are
connected, which ones are more linked and which ones have less connections.

Moreover, in order to address our research questions, we would like to build other maps focusing on:

## FURTHER RESEARCH QUESTIONS

- Do bigger universities get more mobility?
- Does the ranking of the university influence its connections?
- How is the variety of links distributed? (map)
- How are Italian universities linked to european universities? (map)
- Are there any trends between faculties and destination in a foreign country?
- Where are the most connected universities located?
